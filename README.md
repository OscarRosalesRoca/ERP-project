# PRESENTATION

ERP project created for the subject "Business Management Systems" at DigiTech by Ã“scar Rosales Roca.
Work in progress. I intend to continue improving the functionalities of the project once the delivery is finished.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

To run the program you will need to download the ERP package that contains all the code, have an IDE and XAMPP, where we will use the MySQL functions for the database and APACHE to run the server locally and manage our database.
...

## THINGS TO DO

- Rewrite many class and common words between files, use the same nomenclatures.
- Compartmentalize css in folders and group general styles.
- Change the styles so that the records in the application look with one line light grey and the next white.
- Debug database.
- Add search function.
- Look at changing the workflow: Being able to create a product when making an invoice, create a product without a supplier, invoice a product that is not yet in stock or purchased. More flexibility.
